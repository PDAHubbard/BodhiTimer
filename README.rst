BodhiTimer BETA
=================

Bodhi Timer is a countdown timer based on the free and open source TeaTimer by Ralph Gootee: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=goo.TeaTimer

It uses Android's built-in notification system to trigger the alarm, which means it works even when your device is asleep.

Features
========

- uses scroll and fling gestures to set the time, which is faster than clicking buttons.  
- two animations: fade in Bodhi leaf and animated circle
- four themes for the animated circle: three colour themes and a draw in Zen Enso (brush circle)
- change notification sound to any ring tone, or use two included sounds (a Burmese bell and a Buddhist chant)
- vibration and LED blinking options
- free and open source: https://github.com/yuttadhammo/BodhiTimer
